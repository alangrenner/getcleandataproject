Welcome to my project!
Hi! This is my project on the Coursera peer review project of the course Getting and Cleanning Data. My name is Alan and I'm still learning all this data and programming thing, so I welcome any constructive criticism. Thank you!
The R script will download the dataset to a your WD in a "data" file (creating it just in case it doesn't exist), unzip the files and then create several datasets. After that, the  script will rename some variables and make the dataset more readable for humans. It will then merge the sets into one dataset, do some more renaming and then tidy it using aggregate. After that, the tidy data is saved in a new txt file. The codebook explain every step of the process.
